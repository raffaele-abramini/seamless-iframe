## Usage

````jsx
import { SeamlessIframe } from "seamless-iframe";

const myHtml = sanitize("<div>hello</div>"); // HTML sanitisation is still recommended.

export const MyPage = (props) => {
    return ( 
        <SeamlessIframe
            sanitizedHtml={myHtml}
            customStyle={`
                body {
                    font-family: sans-serif;
                }
            `}
        />
    );
}
````

### Props

| Property | Type | Description  | Default |

| `heightCorrectionOnResize` | Boolean | Whether to re apply the height on resize. Off is `heightCorrection` is false | true | 
| `debounceResizeTime` | Number | Debounce time for reapplying height on the window resize event. If set to 0, no debounce function will be applied | 250 |
| `interceptLinkClicks` | Boolean | Whether to listen to link clicks. If enabled, the parent window will show a confirmation whenever a link in the iframe gets clicked | false |

## Abstract

### What does this library do?

It provides a React component with a set of utilities to render custom HTML in an iframe that looks as if it was part of your page.

Normal iframes in fact:
1. don't inherit styles from the parent window
1. don't provide an easy way to set their full height
1. don't allow users to open links on the top level window
1. don't prevent scripts to change the iframe location

Here's where SeamlessIframe comes in handy.
The generated iframes will **automatically set their height** depending on the content,
and they will **inherit the parent window or custom styles**.
In addition, it allows you to quickly **customise what happens when a user clicks on a link**.
If a script (that somehow made it through the sanitization process) inside the iframe tries to manipulate the location (url) of the iframe, SeamlessIframe will intercept it and prevent it from happening.   

### Why would you use an iframe to render html?

In summary, **further security**.

There are a number of great sanitized libraries out there that prevents
malicious scripts from being injected in your page.

However, *if these libraries fail* is good to have another layer of security. Iframes
and their powerful `sandbox` attribute prevents a number of potentially dangerous behaviours.
